# workout-tracker
This is the (beginnings of) backend code for what will eventually be a workout tracking app.

There are many of these out there already, but the ones I've tried all fall slightly short of being able to follow the workflow I want for my tracking, and the metrics I want to track and have computed and displayed during a workout. So I'm writing my own.
